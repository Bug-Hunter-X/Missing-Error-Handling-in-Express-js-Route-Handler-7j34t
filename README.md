This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of error handling for invalid input. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version with proper error handling.  The issue arises when a non-numeric user ID is passed to the route.  The improved version checks for this and returns an appropriate HTTP error code (404 Not Found) with a user-friendly message, preventing the application from crashing.
